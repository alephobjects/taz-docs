Your LulzBot\textsuperscript{\miniscule{\texttrademark}} TAZ 3D printer was calibrated at the factory prior to packing. TAZ users do not need to calibrate their printers. 

% Uncomment section below for standalone Slic3r manual. Should never be needed for LulzBot assembled products.
%Before even attempting the first print it is vital that the printer is correctly calibrated. Skipping or rushing this step will result in frustration and failed prints later, so it is important to take the time to make sure the machine is correctly set up. Be sure to complete the Setup and First Print section of this manual before moving forward with Slic3r.

If you are just beginning with 3D printing or Slic3r, LulzBot\textsuperscript{\miniscule{\texttrademark}} recommends starting with our pre-set Slic3r profiles. You can find the TAZ Slic3r profiles at \texttt{https://www.lulzbot.com/Slic3r}. For information on loading and export Slic3r profiles please see page \pageref{sub:exporting_and_importing_configuration}. Note that the pre-set profiles will only work correctly when Slic3r is in Expert mode.

The pre-set profiles will give you Slic3r settings that will work great on most designs. The Slic3r manual can be used as a reference in building knowledge of Slic3r settings while using the pre-set profiles. Once you have a number of prints completed you can use the Slic3r manual as a reference to make small adjustments to the pre-set profiles or begin creating your own profiles.
