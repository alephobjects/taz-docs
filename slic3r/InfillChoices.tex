There are several considerations when choosing an infill pattern: object strength, time, material, and personal preference.  It can be inferred that a more complex pattern will require more moves, and hence take more time and material.  

Slic3r offers several infill patterns, four regular, and three more exotic flavours.  The numbers given in brackets below each figure are a rough estimate of material used and time taken for a simple 20mm cube model\footnote{Taken from http://gcode.ws}.  Note that this is only indicative, as model complexity and other factors will affect time and material.

Certain model types are more suited for a particular pattern, for example organic versus mechanical types.  Figure \ref{fig:complex_object_infill_comparison} shows how a honeycomb fill may suit this mechanical part better because each hexagon bonds with the same underlying pattern each layer, forming a strong vertical structure.

Most models require only a low density infill, as providing more than, say, 50\% will produce a very tightly packed model which uses more material than required.  For this reason a common range of patterns is between 10\% and 30\%, however the requirements of the model will determine which density is best.  Figure \ref{fig:infill_pattern_densities} shows how the patterns change as the density increases.

\label{fig:infill_pattern_densities}
\end{figure}

One aspect to consider is how well the material which makes up the top layer bridges the infill pattern.  Should the pattern have wide gaps then the material may sag and break in between, causing unfinished top surfaces.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,width=0.75\textwidth]{tuning/bad_top_infill.JPG}
\caption{Image of a poorly top-filled print.}
\label{fig:poor_top_fill}
\end{figure}

This problem can be mitigated by calibrating optimal bridging and/or by increasing the number of solid top layers (see p.\pageref{par:simple_general}).
