\section{Overview}
\index{maintainence}
There is little maintenance needed in keeping your TAZ 3D printer running. Depending on your rate of use you will want to perform a quick check of your printer every 2-4 weeks. The following maintenance guide lines will keep your printer printing quality parts.

\section{Smooth Rods}

\index{bushings}
\index{lubricant}
Wipe the smooth steel rods with a clean rag or paper towel. The linear bushings leave a solid lubricant that builds up over time. If you begin hearing squeaking noises while the printer is printing, this is likely a sign that the smooth rods need to be cleaned. NOTE: never apply any lubricant to the smooth rods; the bushings are self lubricating.

\section{PET Sheets}

\index{glass}
\index{acetone}
After repeated use, the PET sheet print surface will begin to wear. To replace the PET print surface, remove the glass sheet from the printer. Peel off the worn PET sheet from the glass sheet. If there is any glue or plastic residue left on the glass surface, clean it with acetone or an alcohol based glass cleaner. Using the green PET sheet from the printer kit lay down the PET sheet onto the glass sheet. Use a credit card or driver's license to smooth down and push out any trapped bubbles under the sheet. For additional replacement PET sheets visit the LulzBot.com store.

\section{Hobbed Bolt}

\index{extruder jam}
The plastic filament is pulled through the extruder by a hobbed bolt. After repeated use, the teeth of the hobbed bolt can become filled with plastic. Using the brush or pick from the printer kit clean out the hobbed bolt teeth. If an extruder jam ever occurs, remove the plastic filament from the extruder and clean out the hobbed bolt.

\section{Software}
\index{software}
\index{download}
Every quarter LulzBot will release new stable version of the software. It is best to update the software every time a new version is released. The software is as important in printing quality parts as the hardware. Each quarterly software update can bring advances in print quality. The files are available at \texttt{http://download.lulzbot.com/TAZ/} . You can also updated software versions in the Support/Downloads section of LulzBot.com.

\section{Belts}
\index{belts}
Periodically you will need to retighten the belts on the TAZ 3D printer. For the X axis, using the 2.5mm hex driver, loosen one of the belt clamps. The belts clamps are located on the X axis carriage. To loosen the belt clamp, loosen the M3 screws on each side of the clamp. Using the needle nose pliers, pull the belt tight. While holding the belt tight, tighten down both M3 screws. Y axis belt can be tightened using the Y idler tensioner. Located on the lower front of the printer, the Y idler tensioner has an adjustable bolt at the top of the tensioner. Turn the bolt clockwise to push the top of the Y idler tensioner away from the aluminum frame and tighten the belt.

\section{Hot End}
\index{hot end}
\index{acetone}
The hot end should be kept clean of extruded plastic by removing melted plastic strands with the tweezers. If melted plastic builds up on the hot end nozzle it can be cleaned with a paper towel soaked with acetone. Make sure the hot end is completely cool before attemping to clean the nozzle with acetone.
