\section{\texttt{Hardware Setup}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Your printer has been calibrated and tested, however, after unpacking all of the components you will need to re-mount the Y axis onto the frame and connect the bed and Y axis connectors. You will also need to re-mount the extruder tool head. Please follow the steps completely to make certain that the extruder tool head and Y axis are re-mounted correctly. You will then be on your way to your first print. Use Fig. \ref{fig:axes} to see which direction the three axes move, as the following instructions will reference the X, Y, and Z axes.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,angle=0,height=0.4\textheight,width=1.0\textwidth]{axes.JPG}
\caption{Axes movement directions}
\label{fig:axes}
\end{figure}

\item Place the TAZ frame and Y axis assembly on a flat and level surface. Move to the Y axis assembly and find the four Y axis bolts. The four bolts located on the Y axis aluminum frame bars, have large plastic knobs that allow the bolts to be easily turned by hand (Fig. \ref{fig:Y_axis_bolts}, page \pageref{fig:Y_axis_bolts}). Turning counter clock-wise, remove each of the four Y axis bolts and set aside (Fig. \ref{fig:remove_Y_axis_bolts}, page \pageref{fig:remove_Y_axis_bolts}).

\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Remove the four Y axis bolts}
\label{fig:remove_Y_axis_bolts}
\end{figure}

\item On the TAZ frame locate the four Y axis mount brackets shown in Fig. \ref{fig:frame_Y_axis_mounts} (pg. \pageref{fig:frame_Y_axis_mounts}). With the print surface facing up and the stepper motor end of the Y axis facing back, slide the Y axis assembly in between the Y axis mount brackets. The four Y axis mount brackets will line up with the Y axis bolt holes on the Y axis assembly. Thread the four Y axis bolts through the brackets, into the Y axis assembly (Fig. \ref{fig:Y_axis_bolts_tighten}, page \pageref{fig:Y_axis_bolts_tighten}). Before completely tightening the Y axis bolts make sure the Y axis aluminum bars are pushed down against the TAZ frame lower bars. While pushing on the black Y axis square extrusions tighten the four Y axis bolts. The printer can now be set flat on the table.

\caption{Screw in and tighten the four Y axis bolts}
\label{fig:Y_axis_bolts_tighten}
\end{figure}

\item The next step of installing the Y axis is connecting the print surface connectors and Y axis connectors. Pull the print bed completely to the front of the printer to get access to the Y axis connectors. You will find matching male and female 4 pin stepper motor connectors and two pin end stop connectors. Connect the matching male and female connectors (Fig. \ref{fig:Y_axis_connectors}, page \pageref{fig:Y_axis_connectors}); make sure the connector's lock clicks to be sure that it is secured.

\caption{Connect the two connectors found at the rear of the Y axis}
\label{fig:Y_axis_connectors}
\end{figure}

\item Locate one of the three small black zip ties that are included in the documents bag. Wrap and tighten the zip tie around the Y axis wiring and the black Y axis frame extrusion as shown in figure \ref{fig:Y_axis_connectors_zip-ties} (page \pageref{fig:Y_axis_connectors_zip-ties}).

\caption{Wrap and tighten a zip tie around the Y axis wires to the Y axis frame.}
\label{fig:Y_axis_connectors_zip-ties}
\end{figure}

\item Locate the two connectors to the left of the print bed. Connect the matching female and male large two pin heat bed connectors and the small two pin thermistor connectors, again making sure the connectors lock(Fig. \ref{fig:bed_connectors}, page \pageref{fig:bed_connectors}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

\caption{Connect the two connectors on the left of the print bed}
\label{fig:bed_connectors}
\end{figure}

\item Locate the other two small black zip ties that are included in the documents bag (Fig. \ref{fig:bed_connectors_strain_relief}, page \pageref{fig:bed_connectors_strain_relief}). Wrap the two zip ties through the slot, located on the left rear of the aluminum bed plate, and around the print bed wires (Fig. \ref{fig:bed_connectors_strain_relief_done}, page \pageref{fig:bed_connectors_strain_relief_done}). Tighten the zip ties snug so the wire cannot move freely. Cut off the excess end of the zip ties with the needle nose pliers included in the tool bag.

\label{fig:bed_connectors_strain_relief_done}
\end{figure}

\item \textcolor{red}{Before proceeding make sure that the four red shipping clamps on the Z axis smooth rods have been removed.}

\item Move the X axis carriage to the center of the smooth rods. If you have not already done so, remove the foam from between the X axis carriage and the left hand X axis end. Locate and remove, with the included 2.5mm hex driver, the tool head M3 screw in top center of the X axis carriage (Fig. \ref{fig:tool_head_screw}, page \pageref{fig:tool_head_screw}). Place the extruder tool head mount onto the X axis carriage bottom first. The extruder mount will slide into the bottom portion of the carriage and self center (Fig. \ref{fig:tool_head_placement}, page \pageref{fig:tool_head_placement}).Make sure that the tool head mount is fully seated. Use the 2.5mm driver and the previously removed M3 screw to secure the extruder tool head onto the X axis carriage.

\caption{Connect the two tool head connectors}
\label{fig:tool_head_connectors}
\end{figure}

\item Connect the stepper motor and the hot end to the existing wiring harness located at the top of the X axis carriage. Connect the extruder assemblies' 4-pin connectors: match the orange/red wire connector pair for the hot end and the mixed color wired connector pair for the extruder motor (Fig. \ref{fig:tool_head_connectors}, page \pageref{fig:tool_head_connectors}). Connect the matching pairs together so they lock and click.

\item Now that the Y axis is mounted and the extruder tool head is installed you should set your printer on a stable, flat, and level surface large enough for extra space around the printer. Make sure your printer work space is clear of anything that could obstruct the movement of the printer. Move the Y axis to the back of the printer to ensure unobstructed movement of that axis. \textcolor{red}{Make sure there are no flammable fabrics or liquids near the printer space}. It is also best to not put your printer near a drafty window or air conditioner vent.

\index{power supply}
\index{USB cable}
\item Unwrap the power supply and USB cables.

\textcolor{red}{MAKE SURE THE POWER SUPPLY IS COMPLETELY UNPLUGGED BEFORE MOVING ON TO THE NEXT STEP}.

\index{electronics receptacles}
\item Locate the power supply and USB receptacles along the back of the TAZ electronics enclosure
(Fig. \ref{fig:electronics_plugs}, page \pageref{fig:electronics_plugs}). Locate the power supply and the included AC power cable (Fig. \ref{fig:power_supply}, page \pageref{fig:power_supply}). Locate the DC power cable plug on the power supply. Connect the DC locking plug into the DC connector on the TAZ electronics enclosure (Fig. \ref{fig:ps_plug}, page \pageref{fig:ps_plug}). The plug is keyed which may require rotating the plug until the keys line up and the plug can be pushed in. Once you have pushed in the plug turn the locking sleeve clockwise until it is tight against the electronics enclosure (Fig. \ref{fig:electronics_plugs_plugged-in}, page \pageref{fig:electronics_plugs_plugged-in}).

\end{figure}

\item Locate, on the right of the power supply, the red AC voltage switch. Depending on your location you will need to change the AC voltage switch to 115V or 230V. North America is generally 115V and the majority of other regions are 230V. You can find general voltage by country at \texttt{wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains\_electricity\_by\_country}. Make sure that when plugging in the AC power cable it is directly plugged into the wall and \textbf{not} into a power strip. The TAZ 3D printer can potentially pull more current than the power strip will support and may lead to undesirable performance.

\item Plug in the USB cable, B plug (smaller square plug) side, into the USB receptacle on the printer electronics. Plug the other end of the USB cable, (larger), into your computer.

\index{PTFE tube}
\item Locate the filament guide with attached PTFE tube
(Fig. \ref{fig:filament_guide}, page \pageref{fig:filament_guide}). The filament guide attaches to the filament guide mount which can be found on the top right side of the printer frame (Fig. \ref{fig:filament_guide_mount}, page \pageref{fig:filament_guide_mount}). The filament guide easily pops on to the guide mount as shown in figure \ref{fig:filament_guide_mount} (pg. \pageref{fig:filament_guide_mount}).

\section{\texttt{ABS \& Acetone Solution Prep}}
Please refer to section \ref{sec:ABS/Acetone Glue} (page \pageref{sec:ABS/Acetone Glue}) for instructions in preparing the ABS/Acetone Glue for use when printing with ABS. As it will take some time to dissolve the ABS into the acetone it may now be a good time to make the solution. If you are printing with PLA, the ABS and Acetone solution is not needed.

\section{Installing Printrun}
Printrun contains several different applications that can be used to control the TAZ 3D printer. It can be installed on Windows, Mac OSX and Linux based computers. Most users will use Pronterface, the graphical user interface for printrun, when using a host software to interact with the 3D printer. \texttt{Pronsole} allows printing from the command line, and can be used for scripting and some automation. \texttt{Plater} allows you to arrange and combine several STL files into one. More information on the other programs within the Printrun package can be found at \texttt{https://github.com/kliment/Printrun}. Printrun can be downloaded from \texttt{LulzBot.com/support/downloads}. Download the version for your operating system and extract. You will need an archive manager to extract the files. If you do not have one installed we recommend using 7-zip, which can be downloaded for free at \texttt{www.1-zip.org}.

\section{Using Printrun}

%\begin{figure}[hbt]
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,angle=0,height=0.4\textheight,width=1.0\textwidth]{printrun.png}
\caption{Printrun}
\label{fig:printrun}
\end{figure}

Printrun is used to control the printer from a computer. It is divided into 4 main parts: The buttons over the top are used to connect to the printer, load files and start \& stop prints.

The movement controls are on the left hand side, with the G-code preview window in the center and the Log window and Terminal command entry box on the right hand side (Fig. \ref{fig:printrun_labels}, page \pageref{fig:printrun_labels}).

\subsection{Connecting to the TAZ 3D Printer}
To connect to the printer, select the correct port by using the drop down arrow and selecting the active port. The \texttt{Port} button will refresh the Port listing. Once selected choose the default \texttt{115200} buad rate and press \texttt{Connect}. Pronterface will open a connection to the printer and display firmware information in the Log window. If nothing is displayed in the Log window verify you have the correct port and connection speed selected.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Movement}

\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true,angle=0,height=0.4\textheight,width=1.0\textwidth]{printrun_controls.png}
\caption{Movement Controls}
\label{fig:printrun_controls}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Motors off}
The TAZ 3D printer can be moved on all three axes independently. If you would like to do so by hand, use the \texttt{Motors off} button to unlock all the stepper motors. Once unlocked they can be moved by hand. Keep in mind that there is no positional feedback, so if you move an axis you will need to re-home in order to re-establish the hot end's position. 

\subsubsection{mm/min ZY:/ Z:}
These settings control the manual jog speeds when driven with Pronterface. Use caution when changing these figures. Moving the axes too fast can cause the printer to lose steps. If that occurs with the Z axis, it can potentially cause the Z axis to become out of square.

\subsubsection{Homing}
Each axes can be homed either individually or together. Press the \texttt{HomeX} button to move the X axis to the left until it activates the end stop. Once the X axis end stop is activated, the X axis carriage will 'bounce'- it will move over and move back to the home position more slowly. Press the \texttt{HomeY} button to home the Y axis. The Y axis platform will move away from you towards the rear of the printer. Press the \texttt{HomeZ} button to home the Z axis. The Z axis will move down towards the heated bed. Make sure that you home the printer immediately after power up. The printer will not know where the not end is until each axes has been homed. Moving prior to home can be risky since the 3D printer will not know it's initial location.  

\subsubsection{X/Y/Z Axes Movement Controls}
Prior to moving the X, Y or Z axis, make sure that you home each axis. The X, Y and Z axes can be moved utilizing the circular movement controls. Each axis can be moved in either fine moves or large moves, ranging from 0.1mm to 100mm.  For example, to move the \texttt{Y Axis} towards you, move your mouse to the \texttt{+y} section until both the \texttt{+y} and the \texttt{100} is highlighted then select that ring section. To move the \texttt{Y axis} away from you, move your mouse to the \texttt{-y} section until both the \texttt{-y} and the \texttt{100} is highlighted then select that ring section. The X axis can be moved in a similar fashion.

The Z axis movement control operates similarly, but the movement scale is different. The Z axis will move in 0.1mm, 1mm and 10mm increments. The top half of the movement bar will move the Z axis up, by the selected units, while the lower half will move the Z axis down, by the desired units.
