Changes for v3.0
================

Images to update
----------------




From Chris Christopher
----------------------
	*Some images need circled point of focus
		-f1.6
		-f1.10
	
	*Check that all figures reference a page of the fig location
		-Ch1.1-1, Fig 1.21 is referenced because the image appears twice
		-Ch1.1-2, First sentence, says to use flat and level surface. What 	does "level" mean to the average person?
		-Ch1.13, whole section listed as confusing
		-Ch3.2, Second sentence is incomplete sentence
		-Ch3.4, Homing and X/Y/Z Axes sections are noted as "Sounds very 	complex"
		-General noting that the figures do not reference the page they are discussed on. I don't think that is normal practice, but something to think about
