\section{Intro}
\index{advanced techniques}
\glossary{3D Printer}{Also referred to as additive manufacturing, is the process of fabricating objects from 3D model data, through the deposition of a material in accumulative layers.}
\glossary{Spool}{Plastic filament coiled and stored on a plastic reel. Preferred over 1.75-mm filament due to improved feeding and better mounting options.}
\glossary{Filament}{Plastic material in a "string" like form, as it is fed to the printer.}
\glossary{ABS}{Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene thermoplastic. Usually extrudes at 230C.}
\glossary{PLA}{Polylactic acid is a corn-based biodegradable polymer. Usually extrudes at 185C.}
\glossary{HDPE}{High-density polyethylene.}
\glossary{Polycarbonate}{A strong and impact-resistant thermoplastic. Usually extrudes at ~300C.}
\glossary{HIPS}{High-impact polystyrene.}
\glossary{Laywoo-D3}{Wooden filament similar to PLA. Forty percent of its content consists of recycled wood. Usually prints at ~180C to 210C. Color can be changed by varying the extrusion temperature.}
After you become familiar with printing using the default settings, a few advanced techniques may help in getting better and more consistent prints from the TAZ 3D printer. Some of these instructions are items and materials not included with the TAZ. With any of these additional items or materials, follow safety and usage guidelines as instructed by the manufacturer.

\section{Changing nozzles}
\index{nozzle}
\glossary{Nozzle}{The metal tip at the bottom of the hot end. It has a small hole where the plastic filament comes out of the printer.}
\index{high resolution}
The TAZ 3D printer ships with a standard 0.5mm nozzle which allows small-layer resolution and up to 0.5mm layers. Although the 0.5mm nozzle will be perfect for most printing applications, LulzBot may also offer smaller or larger nozzle sizes in the future.
\glossary{Layer height}{The thickness of each individual deposited layer of the three-dimensional model when cut with a slicing program.}


\index{hot end}
\glossary{Hot end}{The hot end is the whole part where the plastic melts, including the nozzle, heater block, thermistor, and heat sink. The LulzBot\textsuperscript{\miniscule{\texttrademark}} Hexagon all-metal hot end comes standard on the TAZ 5.}
\index{threaded extension}
\glossary{Threaded extension}{Used to separate the heater block and nozzle from the PEEK insulator. The plastic filament passes through the threaded extension into the melting chamber.}
%\glossary{PEEK}{Polyether ether ketone: an organic polymer used to insulate the hot end due to its mechanical properties at elevated temperatures.}
%In most cases the nozzle is best changed when the hot end is slightly warm. NEVER try to remove the nozzle when the hot end is at extrusion temperature. At higher temperatures the threaded extension expands in the nozzle causing the nozzle to bind if turned. Heat the hot end to \texttt{160°C}. This will soften the plastic inside the hot end and allow the nozzle to be loosened off the threaded extension. Power off the printer and before it cools unscrew the nozzle. Take care when removing the nozzle while the hot end is hot. Wear leather gloves or use a towel to turn the nozzle off the hot end.

\index{wrench}
\index{heater block}
\glossary{Heater block}{Machined from aluminum, the heater block generates heat with a heater resistor and uses a thermistor to measure the temperature.}
\glossary{Thermistor}{A special type of resistor that changes resistance based on temperature. It is used to measure temperature on the nozzle and the heated bed.}
\glossary{Heater resistor}{A special type of resistor that is used to apply heat in a small area.}
The LulzBot Hexagon does not currently have additional nozzle sizes. If a nozzle change is required you will need to tighten the nozzle to the recommended 30in/lb of torque. 

Prior to any modifications make sure the that printer is unplugged from both the wall and the computer. Use a 7mm wrench to turn the nozzle and a 18mm wrench to hold the heater block. A guide on assembling the LulzBot Hexagon hot end is available at \texttt{http://ohai-kit.alephobjects.com}

%\index{anti-seize}
%If you will be changing nozzles frequently we suggest reapplying a small amount of high temperature anti-seize compound to the inside threads of the nozzles. You will need an anti-seize capable of temperatures of at least \texttt{250°C}.

\section{ABS/Acetone Glue}
\label{sec:ABS/Acetone Glue}
\index{acetone}
\index{ABS}
\glossary{Acetone}{A colorless, volatile, flammable liquid ketone, (CH3)2CO, used as a solvent for ABS.}
Acetone is not included or required with the TAZ 3D printer. \textcolor{red}{Acetone and ABS solution is NOT recommended anymore, as the PEI print surface works well without it.}

\index{warping}
\index{bottle}
You may find that during printing, printed parts lift off the print surface on the corners. If you are seeing this turning on \texttt{Brim} in Cura or Slic3r will help increase the surface area of the print, improving part adhesion. If the corners of the part still lift, clean the PEI surface with IPA/ Isopropyl Alcohol and sand the surface with fine grit (2000-3000) sandpaper.

%\index{PET sheet}
%\glossary{PET}{Polyethylene terephthalate.}
%To apply the acetone/ABS mixture, put a small amount onto a paper towel. Now, rub the towel onto the cool PET print surface to apply a \emph{thin} layer of ABS. Generally only one thin layer of the acetone/ABS solution is needed. However, you can apply multiple coats if needed.

\section{Using 1.75mm filament}
\index{1.75mm filament}
\index{PTFE tube}
\glossary{PTFE}{Polytetrafluoroethylene is a synthetic fluoropolymer used in the Budaschnozzle for it's low coefficient of friction. The TAZ 5 does not use a hot end with a PTFE insert.}

Your TAZ 3D printer is set up to use 3mm plastic filament by default and is only capable of printing 1.75mm filament by purchasing a compatible 1.75mm hot end.
