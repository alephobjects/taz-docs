Before you start printing you will need to load a reel of filament onto the filament arm. The filament arm is meant to work with 1-kg and 5-lb plastic filament reels but can be modified to work with other reel and spool types.

\begin{enumerate}

\item You will find the filament arm on the front right-hand side of the TAZ 3D printer (Figure \ref{fig:filament_arm}, page \pageref{fig:filament_arm}). Place the filament reel on the filament arm with the filament feeding counter-clockwise.

\index{feed tube}
\item Feed the end of the filament through the filament feed tube. The filament should now be threaded through the PTFE sleeve and exit near the extruder (Figure \ref{fig:filament_arm_loaded}, page \pageref{fig:filament_arm_loaded}).

\end{figure}

\item Your filament reel is now mounted and ready for the next steps.

\item When changing filament, slide the opposite end of the filament through one of the holes in the hub of the filament spool. This will keep the filament from unwinding from the spool.

\end{enumerate}
