Never touch the extruder nozzle or heater block without first turning off the hot end and allowing it to completely cool down. The hot end can take up to 20 minutes to completely cool. Never touch recently extruded plastic. The plastic can stick to your skin and cause burns. The heated bed can reach high temperatures that are capable of causing burns.

\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Fire Hazard}}
Never place flammable materials or liquids on or near the printer when it is powered on or operational. Liquid acetone and vapors are extremely flammable.

\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Pinch Hazard}}

When the printer is operational take care to never put your fingers in any moving parts including belts, pulleys, or gears. Tie back long hair or clothing that can get caught in the moving parts of the printer.

\subsection{\textcolor{red}{Static Charge}}
